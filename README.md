- Monthly sales data reveals seasonal trends that can inform inventory planning.

## Final Conclusion
To boost sales, businesses should focus on high-performing product categories and regions while addressing underperforming areas. Targeted marketing campaigns and inventory adjustments based on seasonal trends can help achieve the $50,000 sales target and drive future growth.
